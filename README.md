Store wants to create a database that will keep track of all aspects of its appliance business, including (but not limited to) its appliances,
showrooms, warehouses, manufacturers, inventory of appliances, shipments it receives, sales, orders, sales associates, customers, technicians (including who the trainees and their mentors are),
deliveries and installations (who, for whom and when) and so on. 
Store specifically wants to use this database to produce invoices for sales, deliveries and installations. It also wants to be able to keep track of its inventories in showrooms and warehouses. 
The database will be used to determine and store the schedule of deliveries and installations as well as technician assignments.
